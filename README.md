<h1> BlackJack Game </h1>
Created a little blackjack game in Python w rules as follows:


#the deck is unlimited in size.

#There are no jokers.

#The jack/queen/king all count as 10.

#the list of cards is [11,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,10,10]

#all cards have equal probability of being drawn

#cards are not removed from the deck as they're drawn

#computer is the dealer



Referenced from Angela Yu's 100 days of code course!

<h2>Concepts used: </h2>
1. Lists
2. Functions with input and output
3. Random module
4. Recursion

Will be updated the code later to limit deck size and remove cards as they're drawn!
